## Ipsum Below

With nearly 20 years of programming and software development experience, 
I started out teaching myself programming while in High School. 
I put myself through college working for a local Internet Service Provider as a programmer.
 Before finishing college, I developed and sold an award winning website to a Dot-Com start-up.
 After college, 
 I have worked at several companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises focusing on Java and client-side technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
